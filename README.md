As a person from Wales I need to find out what help i can get with NHS costs in order to get my treatments.

## NHS Costs Checker link
https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/check-for-help-paying-nhs-costs/start 

## My approach
1. First of all i have understood the journey of NHS cost checker
2. Next i have developed mind mapping of the journey.
3. I have explored different scenarios by carrying out manual testing including negative scenarios.
4. Next I have set up a project for automation test.

## Set up
1. File->New->Project-> Maven->Next->FileName->Finish
2. Next I have add on dependency in pom file
3. Next I wrote a feature file with negative and positive scenarios 
Nextstep is to write down step defs and page object in order to glue with the feature file. 
I am currently  in process of learning an automation.But i do have an understanding of framework.  

## Automation support
During my current role, i have provided support to the test lead by creating a feature file, pairing and mobbing session 
for step defs. 
Also, I am currently doing self learning selenium java.
